SMALL IDEAS



"Juggler loved fantasy, he then dug deep with a knife and an enchanted crowbar into the remains of his father's, who died throwing up blood on his hand and begged the villagers, not trickster clothes, to kidnap Kitt and the two talismans they were searching for to scorce Kitt's heart into a waxing buffalo penis and make it a weapon. by Noah Bradley and Greg Rutkowski, trending on Artstation"

AIs will understand the joke: "A man walks into a bar and asks for a beer. The bartender says 'You're out of luck. We've been closed for fifteen minutes.'" because they are faster at processing information and so can understand that the man is referring to the fact that the bar has been closed for fifteen minutes. Humans wouldn't find this joke funny because they wouldn't be able to understand it as quickly as the AI.
