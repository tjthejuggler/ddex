HATICE:
generic animation formatter
	i put a list into a specific file and then run the program with an int argument and it returns something i can put in as an animation prompt

	it is all in the anim folder

---------------------------

make data show when listbox item entered
#i should be able to see everything else about the file when i click on it
	the settings json and my rating json
a way to add data to images(ratings..)
	a seperate json is probably the solution

when dropdown item is selected, check to see if that item in sample is true/false, a number, or a string and set type of
	filtering / input accordingly

#make search field selectable
	#dropdown that is full of all keys
		#if it is number, then we should accept ranges (30 - 50 should work

a way to search for images that only have N modifiers

a way to explore animations
