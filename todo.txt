	stretch animation thumbnails
	get animations in tkinter to play automatically on loop
	consolidate notes on how to make a version of this for animations

animation
	make a way to make it for images or videos
		maybe an argument - but then i cant see images and videos together that have the same prompts
		make a toggle or filter
	here is the way to show video
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36635567/tkinter-inserting-video-into-window


a way to add data to images(ratings..) so i can at least easily mark my favorites
	a seperate json is probably the solution

Filter
	when dropdown item is selected, check to see if that item in sample is true/false, a number, or a string and set type of
		filtering / input accordingly

	#make search field selectable
		#dropdown that is full of all keys
			#if it is number, then we should accept ranges (30 - 50 should work

	a way to search for images that only have N modifiers


make something like anim.py, but instead of putting the same amount of time between each one it takes a format like this
	seconds prompt
	3 cat walking
	8 happy dog running
	...
		and applies a multiplier to each of them and gives a format that either works of centipede or disco

add the new with the band video to obsidian notes and 
	note down how many seconds before each audio cue we put the prompt timestamp
	the minimum distance between prompts we can have
