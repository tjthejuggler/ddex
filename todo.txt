delete every folder named 'partials' from 

make data show when listbox item entered
#i should be able to see everything else about the file when i click on it
	the settings json and my rating json
a way to add data to images(ratings..)

when dropdown item is selected, check to see if that item in sample is true/false, a number, or a string and set type of
	filtering / input accordingly

#make search field selectable
	#dropdown that is full of all keys
		#if it is number, then we should accept ranges (30 - 50 should work

#clean up code, rename and functionize

a way to search for images that only have N modifiers

a way to explore animations

PROMPT GEN
	this should be able to output in a format that works well for centiped

	try this using example prompts with weights and seperated, if it doesn't work, then find some way to trick it
		maybe just seperate things with periods and then use a replace('.', ':2","')

	fill prompt and artist files
		randomly choose some number of them (a different number of them for each generated prompts)
	get artists and prompts from files, 
	randomly choose number of artists, and how to refer to them (by, in the style of)

	my input
		begining
		middle
		end
		general idea
			(maybe like this) GPT3
				happy - a prompt about happiness
				clown - a prompt about clowns
				...
				user_prompt - 

	#prompt generator can be a combination of what things are getting good results and random words from out in
	#	the world. Can probably hook this up to some gpt api

	#scrape all artists/styles/modifier words

	#find a good ai for making sentences more descriptive, look into training them on prompts
		#some sort of sentence enhancer for authors

MISC

	#organize prompt notes
