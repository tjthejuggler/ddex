when dopdown item is selected, check to see if that item in sample is true/false, a number, or a string and set type of
	filtering / input accordingly

find the place that i made the note about the missing images and fix the issue

#make search field selectable
	#dropdown that is full of all keys
		#if it is number, then we should accept ranges (30 - 50 should work

a way to add data to images(ratings..)
	a seperate json is probably the solution

a way to see all data we have on an image

#clean up code, rename and functionize

#i should be able to see everything else about the file when i click on it
	the settings json and my rating json


it goes through every text file in the dirs and makes autocomplete and easy search/filter 
even look in partials for ones that are uncomplete but in same collection

a way to search for images that only have N modifiers



GENERAL AI TODO
	get Centipede diffusion working on an a100 or a6000



PROMPT GEN
	try this using example prompts with weights and seperated, if it doesn't work, then find some way to trick it
		maybe just seperate things with periods and then use a replace('.', ':2","')

	fill prompt and artist files
		randomly choose some number of them (a different number of them for each generated prompts)
	get artists and prompts from files, 
	randomly choose number of artists, and how to refer to them (by, in the style of)

	my input
		begining
		middle
		end
		general idea
			(maybe like this) GPT3
				happy - a prompt about happiness
				clown - a prompt about clowns
				...
				user_prompt - 

	#prompt generator can be a combination of what things are getting good results and random words from out in
	#	the world. Can probably hook this up to some gpt api

	#scrape all artists/styles/modifier words

	#find a good ai for making sentences more descriptive, look into training them on prompts
		#some sort of sentence enhancer for authors

MISC

	#organize prompt notes
