todo:

me:
	create new github repo
	make todo list for hatice

hatice:
	clone this repo https://github.com/tjthejuggler/lightmote_seq
	copy the contents of this(litemote_seq.txt) file into a todo.txt file in the lightmote_seq repo
	download an mp3 and put it into the project folder
	in main.py
		play the .mp3 file with python code
		download another .mp3
		make an argument that allows the user to name one of the .mp3 files and make it play automatically
		check to see which OS is being using
		it allows for keyboard input (msvcrt for windows, getch for linux)
			(it is possibly better to use tkinter instead of msvcrt/getch)
			dont play the song file until the first keypress
			hook up a keypress to pause the song
			translates that keyboard input into lists which are associated with timestamps in a dict
				row 1 - ball 1
				row q - ball 2
				row a - ball 3
				row z - ball 4
					as we go across the row we have different rgb colors
						[255,0,0],[255,255,0],[0,255,0],[0,255,255].... (actually we will have more partial colors in beteen these)
		output is a text file json
			the same as the promgen_artists_formatted.txt
