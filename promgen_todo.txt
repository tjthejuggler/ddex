make an output that works for Centipede Diffusion

get rid of tkinter image viewer
find out why other window is blank, fill it with stats and a place to put in post stats (maybe just stick it in that same dictionary just with my own keys, or maybe stick it into a new file with its own dict)

put most important stats underneath the prompt

make the promp selector use a selector that can be controlled with the arrow keys
	ultimately it should make the image change immediately (prolly using tkinter image but it will need to be resized based on screen size)

make ratings and tags ability
	be able to filter by ratings/tags/(any other property)

rate all pics
	make a way to input rating into ddex

make pre-prediction text format

set up a100 with multiprompt code

get lots of great prompts

hook colab export directly to local dir to save time

make it default to showing the ddex name selector on bottom monitor and the image on the top

EVENTUALLY
	super tags, (portraits, trippy, landscape..)
		it uses these tags to give certain artists/styles extra likeliness to be selected
	the ai could go out of its way to combine artists from various groups that should make interesting contrasts
artstation variation
	use deviantart
	trending on
	featured on



README
This script makes AI image generation prompts.

$ - random style
@ - random artists
^ - random keyword
: - if alone, random weight
:3 - designated weight of 3
this - 'this' with no weight
that: - 'that with a random weight'
, - seperates prompts
,, - the space between these indicates a completely random modifier
this is> - 'this is' plus a completion prompt
<was clear - a pre completion prompt with 'was clear' after it

example:
	python3 promgen.py "this is a big>:,@:,@:,$:" 
		gets gpt3 response with "this is a big", gives it a random weight, then gets 2 artists and a style, 
			and gives them random weights
