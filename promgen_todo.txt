continue checking new format thing for bugs and testing prompts


get lots of great prompts
eventually the artists can be put into categories
	the ai could go out of its way to combine artists from various groups that should make interesting contrasts
artstation variation
	use deviantart
	trending on
	featured on
artists into "in the style of"
find out how to do gpt3 with a blank before it
add new pics to ddex
make ratings
rate all picks
make prediction text
set up a100 with multiprompt code

eventually
	super tags, (portraits, trippy, landscape..)
		it uses these tags to give certain artists/styles extra likeliness to be selected

user tells 
	how many(or up to how many), -artnumran 3 -artnum 3
	the names and numbers of any definite ones
		$ - random style
		@ - random artists
		^ - random keyword
		: - if alone, random weight
		:3 - designated weight of 3
		this - 'this' with no weight
		that: - 'that with a random weight'
		, - seperates prompts
		,, - the space between these indicates a completely random modifier
		this is> - 'this is' plus a completion prompt
		<was clear - a pre completion prompt with 'was clear' after it

example:
	python3 promgen.py "this is a big>:,@:,@:,$:"

			and gives them random weights
