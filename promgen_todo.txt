PROMPT GEN
	this should be able to output in a format that works well for CD
		not a high priority because we can bypass the CD specific input and just use DD style

	figure out exactly what that weight bug is, i think i am unable to give a prompt>:9 and keep that 9 there

	fill prompt and artist files
		randomly choose some number of them (a different number of them for each generated prompts)
	get artists and prompts from files, 
	randomly choose number of artists, and how to refer to them (by, in the style of)

	my input
		begining
		middle
		end
		general idea
			(maybe like this) GPT3
				happy - a prompt about happiness
				clown - a prompt about clowns
				...
				user_prompt - 

	#prompt generator can be a combination of what things are getting good results and random words from out in
	#	the world. Can probably hook this up to some gpt api

	#scrape all artists/styles/modifier words

	#find a good ai for making sentences more descriptive, look into training them on prompts
		#some sort of sentence enhancer for authors

todo

make an output that works for Centipede Diffusion

get rid of tkinter image viewer

put most important stats underneath the prompt

make the promp selector use a selector that can be controlled with the arrow keys
	ultimately it should make the image change immediately (prolly using tkinter image but it will need to be resized based on screen size)

make ratings and tags ability
	be able to filter by ratings/tags/(any other property)

rate all pics
	make a way to input rating into ddex

make pre-prediction text format

set up a100 with multiprompt code

get lots of great prompts

hook colab export directly to local dir to save time

make it default to showing the ddex name selector on bottom monitor and the image on the top

EVENTUALLY
	super tags, (portraits, trippy, landscape..)
		it uses these tags to give certain artists/styles extra likeliness to be selected
	the ai could go out of its way to combine artists from various groups that should make interesting contrasts
artstation variation
	use deviantart
	trending on
	featured on



README
This script makes AI image generation prompts.

$ - random style
@ - random artists
^ - random keyword
: - if alone, random weight
:3 - designated weight of 3
this - 'this' with no weight
that: - 'that with a random weight'
, - seperates prompts
,, - the space between these indicates a completely random modifier
this is> - 'this is' plus a completion prompt
<was clear - a pre completion prompt with 'was clear' after it

example:
	python3 promgen.py "this is a big>:,@:,@:,$:" 
		gets gpt3 response with "this is a big", gives it a random weight, then gets 2 artists and a style, 
			and gives them random weights
