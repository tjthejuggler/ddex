HATICE
	find art styles that are not in promgen_styles.txt

	find good gpt3 art where the artist also shared their prompt and add their prompts to the list in 
		promgen_prompts.py

PROMPT GEN
	fill prompt and artist files
		randomly choose some number of them (a different number of them for each generated prompts)
	get artists and prompts from files, 
	randomly choose number of artists, and how to refer to them (by, in the style of)

	my input
		begining - current way of doing it, my prompt goes at the beginning
		middle - my prompt goes in the middle
		end - my prompt goes at the end
		general idea
			(maybe like this) GPT3
				happy - a prompt about happiness
				clown - a prompt about clowns
				...
				user_prompt - 
		extra descriptive - my prompt becomes more descriptive
			possible prompt: what is an extremely descriptive way to say "a man running" in a single sentence?

set up a100 with multiprompt code

hook colab export directly to local dir to save time

make it default to showing the ddex name selector on bottom monitor and the image on the top

EVENTUALLY
	super tags, (portraits, trippy, landscape..)
		it uses these tags to give certain artists/styles extra likeliness to be selected
	the ai could go out of its way to combine artists from various groups that should make interesting contrasts
artstation variation
	use deviantart
	trending on

README
This script makes AI image generation prompts.

$ - random style
@ - random artists
^ - random keyword
: - if alone, random weight
:3 - designated weight of 3
this - 'this' with no weight
that: - 'that with a random weight'
, - seperates prompts
,, - the space between these indicates a completely random modifier
this is> - 'this is' plus a completion prompt
<was clear - a pre completion prompt with 'was clear' after it

example:
	python3 promgen.py "this is a big>:,@:,@:,$:" 
		gets gpt3 response with "this is a big", gives it a random weight, then gets 2 artists and a style, 
			and gives them random weights
