TODO
	find out if i have access to openai jukebox
	find out if LD in CD can have bigger images sizes, maybe 500,500 doesnt work because it is not appropriately divisible by something

	get CD doing animation
	be able to run CD on external GPU
	Hook up interpolation directly to CD


MUSIC
	http://dig.ccmixter.org
	open ai jukebox 

ANIMATION CREATION WORKFLOW
	AI or CC music
	DD,CD to make original animation
	rife to interpolate (maybe find better interpolation)
	kdenlive to change speed and add music


OBSERVATIONS
	maybe put new prompt a bit before audio cue
	big changes between different kinds of images is good because it makes the image totally change instead of being just slightly different

ARTISTS
	Lisa Frank - cute
	Hans R - creep
